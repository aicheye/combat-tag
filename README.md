## Features:
- Combat disconnect punishing
  - Reduced health to half a heart (can be configured to instantly kill)
  - Reduced absorption
  - Poison
- TP cooldown (ender pearls and chorus fruit)
  - By default, the cooldown starts as soon as the player enters combat
- Enchanted golden apple cooldown
  - By default, the cooldown only starts after eating the first enchanted golden apply
- Elytras disabled while combat tagged
- Players currently combat tagged have a red username
- Combat bar to indicate how long until the player's combat tag expires
- **Fully configurable**

### Note:
An unexpected server shutdown **will** count as a disconnect (stopping the server gracefully will not).

By default, /teammsg and /team are disabled
- All players in combat are put on a "combat" team for the sake of username colouring
- Disabling username colouring also re-enables these commands
